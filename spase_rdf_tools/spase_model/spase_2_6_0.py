        layer.
    :cvar EARTH_NEAR_SURFACE_SUB_AURORAL_REGION: When considering the
        case of the Earth, the sub-auroral region typically refers to
        two latitudinal bands, one in the northern hemisphere and the

        low 60 deg latitude. The concept sub-auroral regions does not
        apply to all bodies in the solar system and different
        latitudinal ranges would apply for each body case by case. The
        sub-auroral regions may be defined by using either

        criteria (1) is in orbit around the Sun, (2) has sufficient mass
        to assume hydrostatic equilibrium (a nearly round shape), and
        (3) has "cleared the neighborhood" around its orbit. This
        definition is still controversial to this day. Many members of
        the community believe that Pluto, which was demoted to the
        status dwarf planet, should maintain its planet status.

        related to the gyromotion of a particle in a magnetic field that
        is either static or slowly varying with respect to the
        gyroperiod. The magnetic moment is usually denoted by using the
        lower-case Greek letter for mu, &amp;#956;, and can be
        calculated by using &amp;#956;=m(u^2/2B) where m is the particle
        mass, u is the velocity of the particle perpendicular to the
        constant or average magnetic field direction, and B is the
        magnitude of the magnetic field strength.
    :cvar ADIABATIC_INVARIANT_BOUNCE_MOTION: The second adiabatic
        invariant is associated with periodic bounce motion of charged
        particles trapped between two magnetic mirrors on a magnetic
        field line. The second invariant, termed J, is defined by using
        the integral J=m &amp;int; v||*ds where m is the mass of the
        charged particle, v|| is the particle velocity along the field
        line, and ds represents elemental arc lengths along the field
        line. The second adiabatic invariant is conserved as long as
        changes in the background magnetic field occur at time scales
        much longer than the bounce time of the charged particles.
    :cvar ADIABATIC_INVARIANT_DRIFT_MOTION: The third invariant for
        charged particle motion in a dipolar magnetic field is

        is equal to one.
    :cvar COUNT_RATE: The number of events per unit time.
    :cvar COUNTS: The number of detection events occurring in a detector
        over the detector accumulation time.
    :cvar CURRENT: It is the scalar quantity giving the net charge
        (summed over charged particle species) per unit time flowing
        across a given surface.
    :cvar CURRENT_DENSITY: It is the vector quantity giving the net
        charge (summed over charged particle species) per unit cross-
        sectional area per unit time flowing through a given point.
        Measurements of current density are often provided in terms of
        the magnetic perturbations (superposed upon a background
        magnetic field, if present) associated with the current density.
    :cvar DYNAMIC_PRESSURE: Dynamic pressure is a measure of the kinetic
        energy per unit volume of a fluid. For instance, the solar wind
        dynamic pressure or ram pressure for a purely proton plasma is
        equal to m&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; n V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
        where m&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the proton mass, n is the
        proton number density, and V is the solar wind speed.
    :cvar ENERGY: The capacity for doing work as measured by the
        capability of doing work (potential energy) or the conversion of

        measurement of flux per unit time.
    :cvar GEOMETRIC_FACTOR: A measure of the gathering power of a
        particle detector. The geometric factor can be used to correct
        particle measurements by accounting for the fact that only a
        fraction of the source particles is able to gain entry through
        the aperture of a detector. For an isotopic source distribution,
        the geometric factor corresponds to the solid angle subtended by
        the aperture. In practice, determination of the geometric factor
        requires numerical modeling and depends on detector design and
        the characteristics of the source.
    :cvar GYROFREQUENCY: The number of gyrations around a magnetic
        guiding center (field line) a charged particle makes per unit
        time due to the Lorentz force.

        typically computed as third moment of a distribution function.
    :cvar LSHELL: The L-shell is the magnetic equatorial radius (in
        units of planetary radii) of a dipole magnetic field line. For
        instance, if the L-shell value equals 6 say at Earth, the
        magnetic field lines cross the magnetic equator at six Earth
        radii. The L-shell concept can be applied generally to any
        magnetized planet or satellite with a dominant dipolar magnetic
        field moment.

        (e.g., aerosols).

        particle.
    :cvar NUMBER_DENSITY: The number of particles per unit volume.
    :cvar NUMBER_FLUX: The number of particles passing a unit area in
        unit time, possibly also per unit energy (or equivalent) and/or
        per unit look direction.
    :cvar PARTICLE_RADIUS: The mean radius for a Gaussian distribution
        of particles with an axial ratio of 2 and a distribution width
        that varies as 0.5 radius. A value of zero means no cloud was
        detected.
    :cvar PARTICLE_RIGIDITY: The particle momentum per unit charge. The
        particle Rigidity, R, is equal to pc/Ze.
    :cvar PHASE_SPACE_DENSITY: The number of particles per unit volume
        in the six-dimensional space of position and velocity.

        speed of sound in the medium.
    :cvar SOUND_SPEED: The speed at which sound travels through a
        medium.

        with respect to the average. Temperature is properly defined
        only for an equilibrium particle distribution (Maxwellian
        distribution).
    :cvar THERMAL_SPEED: For a Maxwellian distribution, the difference
        between the mean speed and the speed within 69% (one sigma) of

        Interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs).
    :cvar EITWAVE: A wave in the corona of the Sun that generates shock

        conditions. Radio Bursts can be Type I consisting of many short,
        narrow-band bursts in the metric range (80 MHz to 200 MHz). Type
        II consisting of narrow-band emission that begins in the meter
        range (150 MHz) and sweeps slowly (tens of minutes) toward

        two latitudinal bands, one in the northern hemisphere and the

        under the direct influence of the magnetic field of a planetary
        body.
    :cvar URANUS_MAGNETOSPHERE_MAGNETOTAIL: The region of space within
        the magnetosphere of a magnetized planetary body where the
        nightside magnetic field is stretched out in the anti-stellar
        direction by stellar wind interaction into a windsock-like
        shape. For Earth, solar wind-magnetosphere interaction produces
        a magnetotail that extends tailward from a distance of about 10
        R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; on the nightside to downstream
        distances beyond 1000 R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;.

        spacecraft potential is the electric potential of the spacecraft
        relative to the potential of the nearby plasma. The spacecraft

        &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;UH&lt;/sub&gt;^2=&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;pe&lt;/sub&gt;^2+&amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;ce&lt;/sub&gt;^2
